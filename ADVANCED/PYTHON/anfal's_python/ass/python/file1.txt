#File Processing
... #Steps for file processing:
... #1. Open a file
...     #returns a file object or success, IOError on failure
...     #Default mode is 'r'
... #2.Process a file
...     #We can read file's data using the following methods:
...     #-read([size])->Read's size byts or the entire file.
...     #-readline()->Read's one line at a time
...     #-readlines()->Read's alll the lines and returns a list.
...     #We can write data to a file operand for writing or appending
...             #using the following methods:
...     #- write(str)->Writes the string passed as an argument.
...     #-writelines()->Writes all the lines from the list passed as an argument
... #3.CLose the file
...     #Mandatory to close a file.
...     #TO close()  method is used for this purpose
