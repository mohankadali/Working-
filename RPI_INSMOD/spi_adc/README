* To insert the module into the raspberry pi first we need to clearly notice the make file .

* In general x86 make file #KDIR:=/lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build will be like this .

* But for raspberry pi ARM Architecture so we should change the path and we need to add the 
  cross compiled tools like 

        KDIR:=/home/kadali/mylinux(its a source code for the raspberry pi)
        $(MAKE) ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- -C $(KDIR) M=$(PWD) modules

* After getting the .ko file We need to copy that file in to RPI board and normal insmod   
  command use to insert the  module
