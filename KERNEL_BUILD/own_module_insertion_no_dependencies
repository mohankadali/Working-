STEP1 :

we need to write the driver code (.c) with makefile & Kconfig  those should keep in a drivers directory with some name ex:MOHAN

Kconfig contails :
   	
	menu "MOHAN HELLOWORLD"                                                         
   	config MOHAN                                                                       
   		tristate "HELLO WORLD SUPPORT"                                              
      		select RT_MUTEXES                                                           
      		select IRQ_DOMAIN                                                           
  	endmenu 
	
Makefile contains:
	
	obj-m               += mohan.o

Driver code contains :
	Basic hello world and what ever we want to writter for

STEP2:

In driver directory we should have one Kconfig and Makefile we have to update those

Kconfig updates with :
	
	source "drivers/MOHAN/Kconfig"

Makefile updates with :

	obj-y               +=MOHAN/

STEP 3:

After complition of all those  steps we need to run the make  menuconfig and enable the your driver. 
and then make
