In order to allocate memory from kernel various types APIs are used.
1) void* kmalloc( size_t size,int flags);
2) void *vmalloc(unsigned long  size);

Kmalloc() is use to allocate memory requested from the kernel.
The memory allocated is returned by the API and it is physically as well virtually contiguous.
The defintion of kmalloc is usually found in <slab.h> header file.




Vmalloc() is used to allocate memory from the kernel.
The memory allocated is virtually contiguous but not physically contiguous.
The major advantage of vmalloc is that if enough physical contiguous memory is not available 
then it will allocate memory virtually in chunks and will link that memory 
so it appears to be virtually contiguous.
