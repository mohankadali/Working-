*	we need to create a fifo in desired path using mkfifo

*	using open system call we need to open a fifo with permissions(flags)

*	once we open fifo we can write data into the fifo using write system call 

*	same way we need to do in other process till open system call (no need to create a fifo again already created in first process)

*	second process we need to read the data using read system call.

*	once operation done, we needto unlink the fifo using unlink function, otherwise after process termination 
	also the fifo will be stored in memory. 

*	use: we can communicate with two different process 

*	disadvantage: we cant communicate multiple process using single nammed pipe
