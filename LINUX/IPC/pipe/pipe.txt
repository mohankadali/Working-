	
*	we need a two file descriptors one for reading and other for writing.

* 	pipefd[0] - reading 
	pipefd[1] - writing

	
*	while communication, unused descriptor should close a file descriptors to avoid the buffer leakage.

* 	we should know the usage of read and write system calls 
		ssize_t read(int fd, void *buf, size_t count);
		ssize_t write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count);

*	read system call and fgets are blocking mechanism while execution means waiting for the input data.

*	only related or same process can communicate means same executable file with two process.

*	example is pipe (|)
