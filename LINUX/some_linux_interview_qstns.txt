Q with A:

Q:What is IPC and expalin the IPC mechanisms with their advantages and disadvantages?
A:well known

Q:Atomic action in os?
A:Atomic operation are those operations that finish their tasks as a whole i.e. no other interruption is allowed before its completion while critical section is that part of the program which cannot be executed concurrently by more than one processes.

Q:How does Mutex work?
A:Mutex can apply only in atomic operations.  

Q:what is syncronization?
A:The need for synchronization originates when processes need to execute concurrently. The main purpose of synchronization is the sharing of resources without interference using mutual exclusion. The other purpose is the coordination of the process interactions in an operating system.

Q:What is critical section?
A:in concurrent programming, processes shares the resources can leads to unexpected behaviour So, part of the program where the resource accessed need to be protected. that protected section is called as critical section.

Q:What is deadlock? 
A:process are waiting for each pther to release the resources its called as dead lock.

Q:What are different IPC mechanisms? Which ipc do u prefer and why? Which ipc did u use in project and why? How is synchronization achieved, give example?  Did you work on shared memory?  How do u avoid deadlock?
A:well known 

Q:What is the use of pthread condition variables.
A:Explanation: When you want to sleep a thread, condition variable can be used. 
  In C under Linux, there is a function pthread_cond_wait() to wait or sleep. 
  On the other hand, there is a function pthread_cond_signal() to wake up sleeping or waiting thread. 
  Threads can wait on a condition variable.

Q:synchronous meaning?
A:existing or occuring at the same time

Q:asynchronous meaning?
A:not existing or occuring at the same time

Q:Why Scheduling?
A:The Scheduling is the process of managing all the processes in operating system and running the processes at specific time.

Q:Difference between fork,vfork,clone,thread and excec?
A:well known

Q:Can we change the size of message in message queue?
A:Default maximum size in bytes of a message queue: 16384 bytes (on Linux, this limit can be read and modified via /proc/sys/kernel/msgmnb). The superuser can increase the size of a message queue beyond MSGMNB by a msgctl(2) system call.

Q:interrupt vector table
A:It is a data structure that associates a list of interrupt handlers with a list of interrupt requests in a table of interrupt vectors. Each entry of the interrupt vector table, called an interrupt vector, is the address of an interrupt handler. 

Q:ASCII full form?
A:ASCII: American Standard Code for Information Interchange

Q:What is Round robin scheduling?
A:To schedule processes fairly, a round-robin scheduler generally employs time-sharing, giving each job a time slot or quantum[4] (its allowance of CPU time), and interrupting the job if it is not completed by then. The job is resumed next time a time slot is assigned to that process. If the process terminates or changes its state to waiting during its attributed time quantum, the scheduler selects the first process in the ready queue to execute.

Q:Which is the default scheduling algorithm in PC?
A: Completely Fair Scheduler

Q:What is memory management?
A:Memory management is a form of resource management applied to computer memory. The essential requirement of memory management is to 
  provide ways to dynamically allocate portions of memory to programs at their request, and free it for reuse when no longer needed.
  
Q:Virtual memory ?
A:https://searchstorage.techtarget.com/definition/virtual-memory
  Computers have a finite amount of RAM, so memory can run out, especially when multiple programs run at the same time 
  So, system can load larger programs or multiple programs running at the same time, allowing each one to operate as if it has 
  infinite memory and without having more RAM. Means harddisk memory we using indirectly.While copying virtual memory into physical memory, 
  the OS divides memory into pagefiles or swap files with a fixed number of addresses. Each page is stored on a disk and when the 
  page is needed, the OS copies it from the disk to main memory and translates the virtual addresses into real addresses.
  
Q:Why paging?
A:Computer stores and retrieves data from secondary storage for use in main memory. 

Q:What is demand paging?
A:paging and demand paging both are same.

Q:page fault?
A:A page fault (sometimes called #PF, PF or hard fault) is a type of exception raised by computer hardware when a running program accesses a memory page that is not currently mapped by the memory management unit (MMU) into the virtual address space of a process

Q:What is the need of virtual address?
A:well known 

Q:What is TLB?
A:A translation lookaside buffer (TLB) is a memory cache that is used to reduce the time taken to access a user memory location. 
  It is a part of the chip's memory-management unit (MMU). The TLB stores the recent translations of virtual memory to physical memory 
  and can be called an address-translation cache.

Q:What happens when there is no entry in TLB?
A:page fault exception

Q:What is the difference between page fault and segmentation fault?
A:Segmentation faults occur when the memory is not allowed to be accessed (does not exist, or is forbidden).
  Page faults occur when memory that is mapped but not loaded is accessed. 
  They are not errors, and signal to the operating system that it should load the appropriate page into memory

Q:Why segmentation?
A:Segmentation is a memory management technique in which we divide the process Read More into smaller segments. 
  The process is segmented module by module. In main memory, we only store the segments of the process. 
  Process segment table is used to keep the record of segments, its size, and its memory address
      
Q:What is TLB hit and miss ?
A:A translation lookaside buffer (TLB) is a memory cache that is used to reduce the time taken to access a user memory location.
  This is called a TLB hit. If the requested address is not in the TLB, it is a miss, and the translation proceeds by looking up 
  the page table in a process called a page walk.

Q:What is the maximum size the data can be stored in files? How we can store exceeding that?
A:its depends on file system, OS wont involve in size of a file.

Q:Structures maintained by VFS?and use of each?
A:VFS is a part of kernel.
  
Q:How the file last accessed and modified time can be known without ioctl()?
A: ls command, touch command

Q:When various files is opened and memory allocation is done and file is not closed and memory aloocated is not freed,
  what will happen? Will it be closed automatically? Or what happens?
A:As long as your program is running, if you keep opening files without closing them, the most likely result is that you will run 
  out of file descriptors/handles available for your process, and attempting to open more files will fail eventually.

Q:how file can be identified                                             
A:ls -l

Q:What happens if we use only virtual address without physical address
A:we need to use physical addressing also 

Q:Can we have same major number for more than one device file?
A:no, only minor numbers will be same. 

Q:How virtual address is mapped into physical address? Which hardware does it?   
A: MMU

Q:Explain physical memory layout. Explain different segments.

Q:How to register the driver into i2c(i2c-core.c) and how the information pass to i2c.(i2c-core.c)
A:Using the - i2c_add_driver(&ft5x0x_ts_driver);
          And I2c_transfer(this_client->adapter,msg,2) function send the information to i2c.

Q:How the Probe function invoke. and I2c probe function invoke. 
A:"I2c_device_probe()". In "driver/i2c/i2c-core.c".
         Function internally call "i2c_match_id()"
         When the device id and driver id is same then the probe function invoke.

Q:How the probe function is work.
A:When the probe function invoke ..
         1.  First is check the functionality. using "i2c_check_functionality(client->adapter,i2c_func_i2c);" function.
             the function is return 1 if adapter support every this we need.
  
         2.  After this through "Kzalloc()" function create at a space in kernel.
             and using this function "i2c_set_clientdata(client,ft5x0x_ts)" cantain the data and register the memory. 
            
         3.  After this ISR function is called we register the interrupt handler through "ft5x0x_ts_interrupt"
             ft5x0x_ts_interrupt(int irq, void *dev_id);
             this function is a top half. when a interrupt genrate it first go top half.. after this we register the work in 
             bottam half in (work queue). through  queue_work() function. queue_work() function set the data(work) in work queue.
            
         4.  After this using input_allocate_device() function we allocate a memory in input sub system (driver/input/input.c) . 
             and register the data in input_sub_system using same function.

Q:What happen when we touch .
Answer-  In hardware point of view interrupt is occure and using PIC the processor find ISR(interrupt service routine) and 
         Register the data  into bottom half into workqueue.
 
6.How to communicate user space.
A:In probe function last the data is register in input sub system using "input_allocate_device()" function.
         In linux some event is define input sub system link- "ev_key()" for keyboard and "ev_abs()" for touch screen.
         this event is notify the kernel this is a absulute touch.
         In driver/input/input.c internally call "input_sync()" function used to transfer the event handler that the device has transmitted 
         An internally consist set of data.The event is now ready to be accessed by the user space at /dev/input/eventx.

Q:Why we reqvired i2c-omap.c.
A:Beacause client driver can't do anything because client driver is type of device in which we are going to register the i2c and if
         we wan't to work with device , we need a driver and that driver know as "adapter driver".
         input/i2c/busses/i2c-omap.c 
         So the adapter provide the all functionallity to client and all resources.  

Q:What type of platform data we register.
A:Like name of driver ,(ft5x0x_ts) 
         what is the address (0x38)
         Which gpio pin we use(34)
         which I2c we use(i2c2)
         And provide the i2c information like (what is the buredrate data transfer(we select standard mode (100 k/bits))).

Q:where the data is register when we touch .
A:In probe function we create a memory using kzalloc() all data are store in this memory .

Q:Your screen is Multi touch and single touch. 
A:Multi touch(5) . in driver code is a switch case IN this switch case 5 case 5 to 1.
         And unsing calibaration tool we find exact touch and data register in buffer(kzalloc in probe function). 

Q:How to check the touch screen.
A:Using getevent()
         The getevent tool run on the device and provide the information about input device and a live dump of kernel input event.
         Path is "System/core/toolbox/getevent.c"

Q:How many device connect to one i2c.
A:128 (2^7)

Q:why we use i2c_core.c file ?
A:Because slave is a platform dependent and master is platform independent. so i2c_core.c file is help to communicate the both driver.
         i2c_core.c file cantain algorithm to communicate the slave and driver.
Q:What is a static function ?
A:If we define a variable as a static the variable scope local to the block but the value persist in deffrent – deffrent function
  And the static variable store in Data segment in memory segment.

A:typedef is a C keyword that creates an alias for a type. It the part of compitaion time.
  #define is a pre-processor instruction, that creates a text replacement event prior to compilation. When the compiler gets to the code, 
  the original "#defined" word is no longer there. #define is mostly used for macros and global constants.

Q:Who invokes probe function() ?
A:In i2c-core.c file one function i2c-device-probe() this function internally call i2c_match_id[] ;when device id and driver id is match then 
  probe() function is invoke.

Q:What is pull up resistor?
A:If there is nothing connected to the pins of MCU, and if program tries to read the state of that pin, the state will be unknown.This is called floating phenomena. In order to prevent this , floating pins are pulled up (or pulled down) to a specific voltage using the resistor called pull up resistor.
