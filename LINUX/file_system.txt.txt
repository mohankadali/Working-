
Apps - vfs - ext2 - block device drvers - block devices(harddisk)

vfs can communicate with any file system

an hard disk not only contains data we provided also contains some meta data related to hard disk

hard disk contains sequence of blocks

driver can see the hard disk exactly the same way of hard disk looks means driver knows about cylinder, sectors and tracks etc...

mian components of vfs super block, struct inode , struct dentry, struct file, struct address space.

super block  - basic information, aggregated file ystem information 
inode block  - file descriptor 
dentry       - list of entries, everyfile should have entry.
struct_file  - kernel or vfs will open a session through file descriptor(struct_file) its a session based transaction.
address space -  will holds the address of the file (format tree or radix tree or page cache)

super block mainted per file system
inode block maintained per file 
dentry is for directory entry 
struct_file maintained for session open a file struct_file will be alive if close it will remove 
address space is for object embedded in the file



open_namei() - it will translate a file.txt into a corresponding dentry object, vfs will maintain a dentry it will handle.
	
	dentry - inode - address space - data of file (page cache) page tree

		struct_file(f_op,f_mapping , fd[]->in,out,err)


after this multiple scenarios will come into picture 

1. data present in cache. 
2. data need to fetch from hrd disk 
3. data not present in hadrdisk. 




File system:
it is a strctural organization of files on a media.

if we  type ls - li
we can see the multiple file types those are recognized by ext2 file system.
files are nothng but a data 

every file have meta info for actual information,

boot block - blocks(0 to n) 
		|	
		|
	     super block(1) - group descriptor(n) - data bitmap - inode bitmap - inode table - data blocks 	

inode - file descriptor
inodde bitmap - indicate number of inodes present in block group.
data bitmap - indicates the data blocks in block group
