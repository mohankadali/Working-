				PROGRAMS(Optimization is mandatory)

Remove multiple white spaces with single space
Remove duplicate characters
Given a number , postion1, position2 and n , Copy the bits from postion1 n times and paste in position2 n times
Nibble swapping

				TOOLCHAIN

gcc options
gdb options
Make file 
How to switch between threads in gdb?
How to come out of loop in gdb

In the following snippet predict the output when it is given  globally and locally 

	int a[3];
	int i;
	for(i=0;i<10;i++){
		a[i] = i;
	}


19. To predict the output:

a) char *ptr;
	strcpy(ptr,”hello”);

b) char arr[10];
	strcpy(arr,”hello”);

c) char *ptr = NULL;
	strcpy(ptr,”hello”);


write the declarations for below:

1. Array of 10 integers.
2. p is a pointer to an integer.
3. n is a pointer to character.
4. ac is a pointer to a array of characters.
5. s is a pointer to a string.
6. m is a pointer to a array of integers.
7. ap is an array of 10 pointers to integers.
8. ca is an array of 10 character pointers.
9. sa is an array of 5 string pointers.
10. mc is an array of string pointer intialized to months of year.
