OSI layers



				NETWORKING

OSI layer and TCP layer
How connection establishment and connection termination happens?
What are the devices that cane be used in network layer?
How each devices is working?
How routing happens?
Headers
Why connection oriented and connection less?
Can we use connect() in udp?
How TTLis used?
How ICMP works?
How ping works? What will happen when ping to outside network?
Socket programming
Which layer which system call is used ? 
Unix domain Socket? How it is differed from IPC?
Socket address structure and how each call works in the layers?
Why listen is used and backlog?
Host1 and host2 are connected in router 1 and  host3 and host4 are connected to different router
ping from host2 to host3 works but ping from host1to host3 doesnot work why?
How routing is happening from one network to another
How DHCP  work?
How DNS works internally
